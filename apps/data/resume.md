## Summary

Senior Software Engineer and technical leader with 11 years of experience specializing in .NET and building high-performing, maintainable systems. I thrive on leading complex architectural initiatives, from strategically consolidating microservices into a streamlined .NET monolith to migrating critical identity providers to modern platforms like Clerk. My focus is always on enhancing system performance while reducing operational overhead.

Recently, I've championed a major leap in developer productivity by pioneering the integration of AI-powered tools like GitHub Copilot, cutting feature development cycles from weeks to days. I'm passionate about fostering a culture of quality, which I've driven by implementing comprehensive unit and integration testing strategies and taking formal ownership of code quality for core APIs. Ultimately, I love building efficient systems and empowering development teams with the optimized tools and processes they need to succeed.
